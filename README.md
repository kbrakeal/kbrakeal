- Hi, I’m Kylan Brakeall
- I’m interested in finding new ways to implement my psychology background in the tech industry.
- I’m currently learning object-oriented programming in Java, and web development in HTML and CSS, among other languages that peak my interest.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any projects to learn more about the industry and the intricacies of coding/programming.
- You can reach me via email at kbrakeal@asu.edu with any questions, opportunities, or project ideas.
